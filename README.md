## Project Description

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis is a text analysis technique that breaks down text into aspects (attributes or components of a product or service) and then allocates a sentiment level (positive, negative, neutral) to each one.

This implementation uses a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries to achieve this:

-   **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Used for fundamental NLP tasks like sentence tokenization, word tokenization, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and stop-word removal. It also provides the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
-   **Stanza:** A powerful NLP library from Stanford, used here for dependency parsing to understand the grammatical structure of sentences and identify relationships between words. This is crucial for linking opinion words (like "excellent") to aspect words (like "battery").

The overall workflow is as follows:
1.  The input text is processed to clean and structure it.
2.  Sentences are broken down and tagged for parts of speech.
3.  Stanza's dependency parser analyzes the sentence structure.
4.  The code identifies potential aspects (typically nouns) and opinion words (typically adjectives).
5.  By analyzing the dependency relations, the code links opinion words to the aspects they describe.
6.  The sentiment for each aspect is calculated using NLTK's VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).

from absa_main import ABSAAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer (handles all setup automatically)
analyzer = ABSAAnalyzer()

# Basic analysis
text = "The food was delicious but the service was slow"
results = analyzer.analyze(text)
print(results)  # [['food', 0.0], ['delicious', 0.6249], ...]

# Detailed analysis with labels
detailed_results = analyzer.analyze_with_details(text)
for aspect_info in detailed_results['aspects']:
    print(f"{aspect_info['aspect']}: {aspect_info['sentiment_label']} ({aspect_info['sentiment_score']:.3f})")
```

### Option 4: Using Individual Modules (Advanced)

```python
from src.models.model_manager import get_model_manager
from src.core.absa_engine import aspect_sentiment_analysis
from src.utils.text_processing import get_stopwords

# Setup components manually
manager = get_model_manager()
if manager.setup_all():
    nlp, sid = manager.get_models()
    stop_words = get_stopwords()
    
    # Analyze text with core function
    text = "Your text here"
    results = aspect_sentiment_analysis(text, stop_words, nlp, sid)
```

### Option 5: Using the Jupyter Notebook

1. Open `ABSA_(almost_there).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
2. Run the cells sequentially
3. The notebook now includes references to the modular structure
